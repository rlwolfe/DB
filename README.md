# DB
Library Employees Database

We created these diagrams to hold the employee entity and each type of employee possible. They all hold ID (as a primary key), name (first & last), starting work date, birthday and which department/s they work in. They also contain the shifts each employee has with a day (of the week) and time (of day). In addition: the librarian contains the section of the library where s/he works, the preserver contains the specialty in which they work, the manager contains which team s/he is in charge of and the security personal contains the location which s/he guards.

We used Mockaroo to generate data, and we filled in the table with 1000 employees of different types because that was the max amount allowed to produce on Mockaroo
